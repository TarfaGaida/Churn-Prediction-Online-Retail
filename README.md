# 🛒 Customer Churn Analysis - Online Retail
*by Tarfa Gaida*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior and predicts churn (customers who stop using the service) within an online retail environment. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify at-risk customers so businesses can take proactive steps to improve retention and drive growth.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in online retail customer data.
- Build and compare machine learning models to classify and predict customer churn, including:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deliver actionable business insights and recommendations based on analytical findings.

## 🧩 Dataset

The dataset contains comprehensive customer information, including:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location
- **Purchase Activity:** Number of transactions, total spend
- **Platform Interaction:** Visit frequency, customer service engagement
- **Churn Status:** (0 = loyal, 1 = churn)

> **Note:** The dataset is either fictitious or sourced from public datasets for demonstration purposes only.

## 📊 EDA Highlights

Key business questions addressed:

1. Are customers with low satisfaction scores more likely to churn?
2. Do customers with lower total spending have a higher churn risk?
3. Is there a relationship between a high number of product returns and churn?
4. How does customer response to promotions impact churn rate?
5. Which gender has the highest average total spending, and how does this relate to churn rate?

## 🚀 Results & Business Insights

- **Model Performance:**  
  Each model's strengths and weaknesses are benchmarked using relevant classification metrics, ensuring the best fit for real-world application.
- **Visualizations:**  
  The analysis is supported with insightful charts, such as churn distribution, feature importance, and customer segment analyses.
- **Recommendations:**  
  Practical strategies are suggested for targeting at-risk customers and reducing churn, empowering businesses to make data-driven decisions.
